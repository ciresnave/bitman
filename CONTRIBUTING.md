# Contributing

So you're considering contributing to this project?  Wonderful!
First, WELCOME and THANK YOU!  The more minds we have working on this,
the faster we will approach our vision of what it should be.

If you haven't already, please take a moment to read our
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file.  It covers the philosophy behind how we must
all treat this project and the people associated with it.

## Where to start?

A great way to start contributing is to look through the issues on our
GitHub page.  As our core team members look through new issues, we
label them according to what they are (bug, enhancement, etc) and also
label the ones that are going to be especially hard to fix with
"Help Wanted" and ones that should be easy with "Good First Issue".
Github for easy filtering of issues based on those labels which allows
you to easily locate issues appropriate for your skill level.

If you have a specific bug or feature you would like to see addressed,
please search for that issue on GitHub first.  If you can't find a
significantly similar issue, please file a new issue on GitHub and let
us know that you are interested in helping to address it.  We try to
look at every new issue in 24 hours or less, label them appropriately,
and provide any questions we may have for you as well as any cursory
information we can quickly provide that may help with the issue.  Wait
for our response before attempting to write code to fix the issue as
we may already be working on it under another issue and we would hate
for you to waste your valuable time on a task that is already underway.

## Code Quality

In addition to reading and understanding all submitted code, we run
everything through a variety of code quality checking tools.  In the
event that we have issues with the submitted code, we will work with
you to ensure both you and we fully understand the issues and, if we
feel the code is not ready for inclusion in the main branch, we will
often work with you to bring it in line with our standards.

## Test Coverage

We strive to always keep our code as near to 100% test coverage as
possible.  Please try to keep that in mind when submitting code to our
project.  Where possible, please ensure your code is covered thoroughly
by tests that cover both all expected results and expected failures.

## Guidelines for submissions
